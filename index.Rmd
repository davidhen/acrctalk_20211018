## What is social care?

### Sub head 1

* Retrospective observational study

* Included all individuals over the age of 65 in Scotland between April 2015 and March 2016 (n=879,027)

* Data sources
 - Community Health Index (CHI) central register
 - Prescribing Information System (PIS)
 - Unscheduled Care Data Mart (UCD)
 - Social Care Survey


---
## Structure and funding of social care

### Measures

* Time to first unplanned hospital admission in study period (1st April 2015 - 31st March 2016)

<br/>

* Main independent variables of interest: Social Care (SCS) & Multimorbidity (proxy measurement via prescribing)

<br/>

* Also adjusted for age, sex, and socioeconomic position (SEP).

---
## Methods

### Statistics

* Kaplan Meier curves plotted to compared rates for those with/without receipt of social care

<br/>

* Cox Proportional Hazard models used to determine Hazard Ratios (HR) for independent variables on unplanned admission

## Limitations

* Descriptive study - no identification of causal links

<br/>

* Preliminary results - simple model reported here - likely to be over-fitted

<br/>

* Social Care data quality 
 - Misclassification present in SCS
 - CHI flag for care homes high specificity but low sensitivity (Burton et al, 2019)

<br/>

* Proxy measurement of multimorbidity

.footnote[Burton et al (2019) Identifying care-home residents in routine healthcare datasets: a diagnostic test accuracy study of five methods. *Age & Ageing*. **48:** 114-121. https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afy137]

---
## Conclusion

* Preliminary results only - treat with caution

<br/>

* Tentative evidence of an association between social care receipt and unplanned hospital admission

<br/>

* Would be an important finding in the context of integration of health and social care services in Scotland. 

<br/>

* Routine collection of high quality social care data is required internationally to further understand how these services interact
